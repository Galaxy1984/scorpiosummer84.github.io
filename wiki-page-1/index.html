            <b>Crown shyness</b>(also <i> canopy disengagement,<sup>[1] </sup>
            canopy shyness<sup>[2]</sup>

         </i> or <i> inter-crown spacing<sup>[3]</sup></i>) is a phenomenon
         observed in the same treespecies,in which the crowns of fully stocked
         trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps
         .<sup>[4]</sup><sup>[5]</sup>The phenomenon is most prevalent among
         trees of the same species.but also occurs between trees of different
         species.<sup>[6]</sup><sup>[7]</sup>There exist many hypothese as to
         where crown shyness is an adaptive behavior.and research suggests that
         it might inhabit spread of leaf-eatting insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

        <b> Possible physiological explanation</b>

         The exact physiological basis of crown shyness in not certian.
         <sup>[6]</sup>the phenomenon has been discussed in scientific 
         literature since the 1920s<sup>[9]</sup> The variety of hypothese and 
         experimental results might suggest that there are multiple mechianisms 
         accross different species, an example of convergent evlution. 
         <sup>[ citation needed]</sup> Some hypotheses contend that the 
         interdigition of canopy branches Leads to ''eciprocal pruning"
         of adjacent trees . Tree in windy areas suffer physical damage as they 
         collide with each other during winds.As the result of
         abrasions and collisions, there is an induced crown shyness response. 
         Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced by
         neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion. <sup>[10]</sup> If
         the crowns are artitficially prevented from colliding in the winds, 
         they gradully fill the canopy gaps. <sup>[11]</sup> This explains
          instances of crown shyness between branches of the same organism. 
          Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is particularly seen in 
          condition conditions conductive to this pruning, including windy
           forests, strands of flexible  trees, and early succession forests
          wheer branches are flexible and limited inlateral movementr. 
          <sup>[6][12]</sup> By this explanation,variable flexibility in lateral
           branches has a large bearing on degree of crown shyness.
