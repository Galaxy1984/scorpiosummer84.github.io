        <b>Crown shyness</b>(also <i> canopy disengagement,<sup>[1] </sup>
            canopy shyness<sup>[2]</sup>

        </i> or <i> inter-crown spacing<sup>[3]</sup></i>) is a phenomenon
        observed in the same treespecies,in which the crowns of fully stocked
        trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps
        .<sup>[4]</sup><sup>[5]</sup>The phenomenon is most prevalent among
        trees of the same species.but also occurs between trees of different
        species.<sup>[6]</sup><sup>[7]</sup>There exist many hypothese as to why crown shyness is an
        adaptive behavior.and research suggests that it might inhabit spread of 
        leaf-eatting insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>
