    <b>Ingredients</b>
    
     <ul>

         <li> 1 pound Macaroni Pasta</li>
         <li> 2 carrots, peeled and grated</li>
         <li> 3 tablespoons Minced Fresh onion</li>
         <li> 3 Tablespoons Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
         <li> 2 Cups Quality Mayonnaise (Hellmans, Dukes, Japanese Kewpie)
              ** NO Miracle Whip</li>
         <li> 1 cup Milk</li>
         <li> 1 Teaspoon Brown Sugar or Teriyaki Sauce</li>
         <li> 2 Stalks Celery, minced fine</li>
                Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
         <li> 1 Green Onion, sliced fine-- green parts only</li>

     </ul>


    <b>Instructions</b>



  <p><b>1.</b> Cook the macaroni according to the box instructions paying 
          special care to not overcook it. You want it to be al dente.
          Once drained, immediatly add the apple cider vinegar and onions to 
          the warm pasta and stir to mix well. The warm pasta will absorb the 
          vinegar better. 
    <b> 2.</b>Let cool for at least 15 minutes, before adding the dressing 
          mixture so it doesnt seperate.
    <b> 3.</b>In a separate bowl mix the mayo, milk and brown sugar; mix well.
          Once the pasta has cooled toss the macaroni with the dressing. If you 
          are making a day ahead, save 1/4 cup of the mayo dressing to be able
          to add in case it dries out.
    <b>4.</b> Allow to cool in fridge for at least 2 hours.
<b> Finisher</b>When ready to serve add the carrots and mix.
          SPrinkle the top with green onions. Store in a sealed container in the
          fridge. Keeps for up to a week, but it does dry out a little. You can
          add additional milk to thin it a little if necessary.


<i>Notes</i>
          30 minute time in prep includes 15 minutes of rest before adding 
          dressing to the salad as well as the chopping vegetables time. The
          chill time is merely sitting in fridge chilling time.</p>

     <i>SERVINGS:16 SERVINGS PREP TIME:10MINUTES MINSCHILLING TIME:2HOURS
         HRSTOTAL TIME:2HOURS HRS 10MINUTES MINS Haupia is a classic Hawaiian
          dessert that’s cool, creamy, and full of tropical flavour. Also known
           as coconut pudding, my version of haupia is vegan, studded with
            pieces of pineapple, and oh-so-easy to make. 5 (from 3 ratings)</i>



  <b>Ingredients</b>


    <ul>
    
       <li> 15 ounces full-fat coconut milk, 1 can, 403 ml
       <li>¼ cup sugar, 50 grams
       <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract
¼ teaspoon orange extract
4 ½ tablespoons cornstarch, 36 grams
4 tablespoons water, 60 ml
8 ounces pineapple tidbits, 227 grams, drained and cut into small cubes 
(optional)
Instructions 
Add coconut milk, sugar, vanilla and orange extract to a saucepan over medium 
high heat. Whisk until it starts to gently boil.
In a small dish, combine the cornstarch and water to create a slurry.
Once the coconut milk is boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer and quickly whisk 
in the cornstarch slurry.
Once thickened to the consistency of pudding, remove from heat. Fold in half the
 pineapple pieces if using.
Pour into an 8×8 pan. Use an offset spatula to smooth the top.
Sprinkle the remaining pineapple on top and press it gently into the coconut 
mixture.
Place the pan in the refrigerator to cool for at least 2 hours. Once cooled, s
lice into 2” squares. Serve cold.


Notes
To store: Haupia should be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator 
for 3 to 4 days.
To freeze: Haupia can be frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator 
overnight before serving. Note that the texture may change upon freezing and 
thawing; it will be a bit more chewy.
