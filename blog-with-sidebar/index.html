                    Hilda Simms was born Hilda Moses to Emile and Lydia Moses
                    in 1918 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She briefly studied
                    teaching at the University of Minnesota before relocating
                    to New York where she met and married William Simms and
                    gained professional acting experience at Harlem’s American 
                    Negro Theater.

                    In 1943, two years after dissolving her marriage to William, 
                    Simms made her debut in the title role of the theatrical 
                    play Anna Lucasta, becoming the first leading African 
                    American actress to appear in the Broadway hit 
                    production. Originally written for an all-white cast, Simms
                    portrayed a middle-class woman struggling to regain her 
                    respectability after falling  into a life of prostitution. 
                    The theatrical version of Anna Lucasta is considered the
                    first drama featuring African American actors to explore a
                    theme un-related to racial tensions. When the play toured 
                    abroad, Simms maintained the title role while enjoying a 
                    dual singing career in Paris. During the British tour of
                    the play, Simms met and married actor Richard Angarola.

                    The couple returned to the states in the 1950s and Simms
                    embarked on a brief film career.  Her first role was as 
                    co-star to heavy-weight boxing champion Joe Louis.  
                    She played the boxer’ wife in The Joe Louis Story (1953). 
                    Her only other movie role was that of the hatcheck girl in 
                    Black Widow (1954).

                    Simms believed she was blacklisted in Hollywood in the 1950s 
                    because of alleged communist Party in the early 1940s.  
                    affiliations. In an article titled
                    “I’m No Benedict Arnold,” which appeared in the 
                    Pittsburgh Courier in 1960, Simms grew increasingly 
                    frustrated at the limited number of roles that were
                    available for Black women. Those that did exist, Simms 
                    often thought, were racist and demeaning. She also told JET
                    magazine that while her fair skin and features kept her
                    from being cast in stereotypical Black roles, her race 
                    kept her from playing any white characters.Simms’s 
                    outspoken support of civil rights with the Communist Party 
                    in the early 1940s.  Simms reported that the U.S. 
                    Defense Department notified her that the Department of
                    Justice denied her passport in 1955 and canceled her
                    scheduled 14-week USO tour of the Armed Forces in Europe.
                    Simms, who had entertained troops and made War Bond tours 
                    during World War II, felt the Defense Department decision
                    and perhaps dozens of other lost opportunities during that
                    period came from speculation about her affiliation with the 
                    Communist Party in the late 1930s and early 1940s.

                    Unable to continue her film career, Simms continued her 
                    stage career and obtained her own radio program known as
                    Ladies Day on New York’s WOV. She also became an active
                    participant in political movements, serving as the 
                    creative arts director for the New York State Human Rights 
                    Commission where her commitment brought discrimination 
                    against black actors to the public attention and helped 
                    usher in better film roles for luminary African American
                    actors of the era.She went on to get a master’s degree in
                    education from New York’s City College and worked for drug 
                    treatment programs in New York City.
                    She died February of 1994 from pancreatic cancer in at the 
                    age of 75.
