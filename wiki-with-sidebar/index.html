            <h3>Early life</h3>

                
            
            
            
                <p>
                    
                    She was born in Louisburg, North Carolina in 1915, and her
                    father Noah was a tailor. She married Booker Everett in 1933
                    when she was 18.<i>[citation needed]</i>This marriage was
                    dissolved,and she later married actor Rex Ingram.
                    They divorced three years later in 1939. She studied and
                    acted with the Federal Theater in Harlem, which was 
                    sponsored by the Works Progress Administration.[2] 
                    The Louisburg-born suffered extreme fear of flying in an
                    airplane. She turned down several invitations to film 
                    festivals in Germany following this condition. However,
                    following her retirement from Harlem Hospital, 
                    She supported the black film entertainment industry. 
                    She was also part of the Negro Actors team and actively 
                    followed seminars sponsored by the International Agency 
                    for Minority Artists Affairs. Francine was also given the 
                    opportunity to lecture many upcoming  African-American 
                    actors.

                    Hollywood films: Lost Boundaries (1949) and Sidney Poitier's

                    "the most beautiful woman in Harlem" by columnist Billy
                    Rowe in The Amsterdam News, a black-owned newspaper
                    in New York City.[4] Looking back at her career, filmmaker
                    William Greaves commented: "She would have been a superstar 
                    in Hollywood were it not for the  apartheid climate in 
                    America and the movie industry at the time."[5]
